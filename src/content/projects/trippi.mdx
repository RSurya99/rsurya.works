# Trippi

## Detail Project

Trippi is a website based application for finding holiday destinations, flight tickets, and hotels. With this app you can easily find the best holiday destinations based on nearest location, most popular, etc. You can also find and buy plane ticket or lodging closest to the tourist destination. Currently Trippi is only a landing page, but in the future it will be developed into a website based application.

Fun fact: all the tourist destinations you see on this landing page are taken by me when I was on vacation.

## Technology Used

This is a solo project, so I do everything with my own, from research to development. Here are the technologies I use:

### Research

- Google - for googling something
- ChatGPT - for generating ideas and content writing
- Notion - for writing ideas and planning

### Design

- Figma - for designing the UI/UX
- Icon.kitchen - for generating icons
- Unsplash and Freepik - for finding images

### Development

- ReactJS - for building the website (currently still use pure HTML, but for next roadmap I will try to switch to ReactJS if the structure is ready)
- TailwindCSS - for styling the website
- Vercel - for hosting the website

## Project Roadmap
- [x] Design the Landing Page
- [x] Code the Landing Page
- [ ] Research for feature I want to develop
- [ ] Create all design needed
- [ ] Code the Backend (50% of chance I will use restful API)
- [ ] Experiment with the API and find the best dependencies for the project
- [ ] Code the website
- [ ] Deploy the website

Note: This project is still in development, so there are still many things that need to be done. If you want to contribute to this project, you can contact me via email or social media.
