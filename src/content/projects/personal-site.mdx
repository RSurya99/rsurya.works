# Personal Site

## Detail Project

rsurya.works is a personal site that I created to store all my stuff like my writings, projects, and even cheatsheets.

Previously, I also created a personal site ([v1.0.0](https://rsurya99.netlify.app/)), but I feel less comfortable with the colors and styles I was using, so I tried to completely remake it and make it more minimalist.

## Technology Used

This is a solo project, so I do everything with my own, from research to development. Here are the technologies I use:

### Research

- Google - for googling something
- ChatGPT - for generating ideas and content writing
- Notion - for writing ideas and planning

### Design

- Figma - for designing the UI/UX

### Development

- Typescript - main programming language
- ReactJS (NextJS) - framework for building the website
- TailwindCSS - for styling the website
- MDX - for writing the content
- Vercel - for hosting the website

## Project Roadmap
- [x] Research the idea and design all pages needed
- [x] Code the website in desktop version
- [x] Learn & Experiment with MDX
- [x] Make the website responsive
- [x] Add dark mode
- [ ] Add static type checking
- [ ] Refactor the code
- [ ] Performance and SEO optimization
- [ ] Implement CI/CD and add Unit Testing
- [x] Implement Google Analytics
- [x] Deploy the website

Note: This project is still in development, so there are still many things that need to be done. If you found this project is helpful, you can give it a star on [Github](https://github.com/RSurya99/rsurya.works).
