# Tereby

## Detail Project

Tereby is a website based application for streaming television shows for free, users only need to log in and search for the television channel they want to watch. Currently Tereby is only a landing page, but in the future it will be developed into a website based application.

The reason I created this site is because on December 2, 2022, in Indonesia there will be an interruption of analog TV broadcasts so that everyone is required to switch to digital TV broadcasts, but in reality, in the general public there are still many people who are still using analog-based TV and at that time TV digital still has a price that can be considered quite expensive.

Because of that, I want to try to make a site for streaming television broadcasts online for free without being charged anything. Tereby uses Public IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) obtained from all over the world.

Is Tereby legal? Of course!, we don't store any video results because we only turn IPTV public domain into a streaming platform that can be used directly to watch without doing a bunch of settings. For the rest you can read about IPTV here.

## Technology Used

This is a solo project, so I do everything with my own, from research to development. Here are the technologies I use:

### Research

- Google - for googling something
- ChatGPT - for generating ideas and content writing
- Notion - for writing ideas and planning

### Design

- Figma - for designing the UI/UX
- Icon.kitchen - for generating icons
- Unsplash and Freepik - for finding images

### Development

- VueJS - for building the website
- TailwindCSS - for styling the website
- Netlify - for hosting the website
