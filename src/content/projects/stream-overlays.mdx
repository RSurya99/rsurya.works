# RSurya99 Stream Overlays

## Detail Project

This project is a website that provides stream overlays for me if I want to do a livestream. The reason why I made this website is because I hate to control all over component on my OBS, so I want to make my OBS sources more clean and readable, instead of separate each part to component, I rather do joining it all on one website so I don't need to setup anything again. This website is integrated with Gosumemory, Notion, and Trakteer.

## Integration

### Gosumemory

![Live PP Counter](/static/images/projects/stream-overlays/pp-counter)

Gosumemory is a program that can do live tracking to see my activities in osu!, it can also show realtime pp counter and realtime statistic of my liveplay.

### Notion

![Notion Database Table](/static/images/projects/stream-overlays/notion-database-table)

Notion is a platform for writing notes, I use it to write down the title and subtitle of the stream. It can dynamically change from the `Notion Database Table` I have created and will find the latest one with `Current Stream` is checked.

### Trakteer

![Trakteer Latest Donation](/static/images/projects/stream-overlays/trakteer-latest-donation)

Another third app I integrate is is Trakteer, Trakteer is a platform for receiving donations. This website is made to make it easier for me to display the latest donation from viewers.

## Technology Used

Here are the technologies I use:

### Research

- Google - for googling something
- Notion - for writing ideas and planning

### Design

- Figma - for designing the UI/UX

### Development

- ReactJS - for building the website
- TailwindCSS - for styling the website
- Golang - for building the websocket server
- Vercel - for hosting the website

## Project Roadmap
- [x] Design All Overlays
- [x] Experiment with the API and find the best dependencies for the project
- [x] Code the Backend
- [x] Code the Frontend
- [x] Deploy the website

Note: Unfortunately the Trakteer unofficial package I use is not working anymore, so I can't display the latest donation from Trakteer. Now I'm trying to find another way to display the latest donation from Trakteer.
