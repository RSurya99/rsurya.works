# Horizon

## Detail Project

Horizon is a website to create custom keycaps designed for mechanical keyboards.

On this website, You can try the sound from different switches and change the colorway of the keycaps on your own, you can also save the design into SVG if you like it.

## Technology Used

This is a solo project, so I do everything with my own. Here are the technologies I use:

- Figma - for creating design stuff like UI, logo, etc.
- Javascript - main programming language
- VueJS (NuxtJS) - framework for creating the website
- TailwindCSS - for styling the website
- Vercel - hosting platform for the website
