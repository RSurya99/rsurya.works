# Marina Hotel

## Detail Project

Marina Hotel is an online hotel room booking application and company profile engaged in the tourism sector.

## Technology Used

This is a solo project, so I do everything with my own, from research to development. Here are the technologies I use:

- Figma - for creating design stuff like UI, logo, etc.
- PHP - main programming language
- Laravel - framework for creating the website
- TailwindCSS - for styling the website
- AlpineJS - micro framework for interactive animation
