Usually I use this to check between logged in user roles and roles should be able to access the page, yes their basically two array, and I want to check if the logged in user roles contains any element of roles should be able to access the page.

```javascript
const arr1 = ['admin', 'superadmin', 'teacher']
const arr2 = ['teacher', 'staff']
const found = arr1.some(r=> arr2.includes(r))
```

That's it, it will return true if arr1 contains any element of arr2, and false if not.
