## Problem

Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` where all the integers of `nums` are in the range `[1, n]` and each integer appears once or twice, return an array of all the integers that appears twice.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and uses only constant extra space.

## Example

### Example 1:

```bash
Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
Output: [2,3]
```

### Example 2:

```bash
Input: nums = [1]
Output: []
```

## Answer

```py
class Solution:
    def __init__(self, nums):
        self.nums = nums

    def findDuplicates(self):
        import collections
        get = [item for item, count in collections.Counter(
            self.nums).items() if count > 1]
        get.sort()
        print(get)


nums = [1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 6, 2, 2]
test = Solution(nums)
test.findDuplicates()
```
