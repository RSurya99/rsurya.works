After you call the download API, it will return you a blob object. You can use this code to download the blob object.

```javascript
async function onClickDownload(){
  const response = await fetchApi()
  const FILE = window.URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([res.data]))
  const docUrl = document.createElement('a')
  docUrl.href = FILE
  docUrl.setAttribute('download', doc.file_name)
  document.body.appendChild(docUrl)
  docUrl.click()
}
```

When you call the function, it will call the API and if the response is 200, it will automatically turn blob into downloadable file and download it.
