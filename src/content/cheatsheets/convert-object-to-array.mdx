Sometimes I do forgot about how to convert object into array, here's the example

```javascript
const obj = { 'key': 'value', 'key2': 'value2' }
var result = Object.keys(obj).map((key) => [key, obj[key]]);
// result
// [["key", "value"], ["key2", "value2"]
```

After you know the result will be like that, you know what you should do next right? :D
